    # the link between regions and their corresponding genes when converting from gene to region-based regulons) or
    # the end user has to this himselves. The current function signature implements the latter strategy, i.e. the
    # user has to supply the candidate regulatory regions for genes and the original gene-based regulons to
    # be able to do the conversion.

    # Algorithm's skeleton: For each row:
    # 1. Find the appropriate delineation and convert regions in the TargetGenes column of the dataframe to their
    #    corresponding geneIDs.
    # 1.1. This mapping between a region ID and (multiple) gene IDs needs the regions property of a RegionRankingDatabase
    #      together with a regulatory region delineation which can be derived from an element in the context field.
    #      Caveat: (1) Either we provide the delineation instance itself or a string representation. Currently the later
    #      is being done and therefore we need the list of all potential delineations as an extra input parameter.
    #      (2) It is better the precalculate or at least cache this operation because it will be needed for many more
    #      rows.
    # 2. Filter the list of gene IDs based on presence in the original corresponding gene-based regulon.
    # 2.1 The main challenge is to find the corresponding gene-based regulon for each row in the enriched motif dataframe.
    #     This mapping can be resolved by using the name of transcription factor together with elements provided in the
    #     context column (mainly method used for defining a module from the adjacencies; the name of the database is
    #     less informational).
